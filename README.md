# Python-GORILLAS.BAS
Python port of the 1990 QBasic GORILLAS game

It looks very close to the GORILLAS.BAS game. This was ported using ChatGPT, Claud AI and a lot of coding changes to get it right.

Anyway I hope you enjoy and if you think improvments can be made either fork the project or let me know and I will try to implement.
